Using the .loc and .sum methods in Pandas, it is possible to observe the calculation of the payroll by the Salario base column and sum them up. Once this is done, various financial analyses are possible, such as observing how much a quantity X of employees is costing the company per month.

Using methods like .merge, it is possible to merge columns to facilitate analysis, so it is possible to calculate total revenue. With the .len method, it is possible to see the total number of employees who closed contracts per area and subsequently calculate the percentage of these employees.

Finally, some graphs are plotted to generate a visual analysis of the quantity of contracts and employees per area.
